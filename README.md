# DEDCHAT
A dead simple chat room I made to try learn [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Verdict: They're pretty cool.

## Usage

**Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasDower/DEDCHAT.git
cd DEADCHAT/client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
cd ..
```

**Run**

Start the chat server with `./run-server` and then start the web server with `./run-client` and open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. Note the misnomer, they're both servers really, any number of browser clients can connect to the chat.
